#ZT-30 Battery Powered Transmitter

{{< figure src="/img/power/zt30b.png" title="ZT-30B" width=500 >}}

The ZT-30B is a battery-powered transmitter capable of producing time-domain or frequency-domain waveforms into either resistive or inductive loads. As a TEM transmitter, the ZT-30B can deliver up to 30A into a 100m loop with a turnoff time of less than 200 Î¼s. Because the ZT-30B also performs well while transmitting into resistive loads, some customers are using it as a low-power resistivity transmitter. When used for resistivity, it is necessary to monitor the current since the transmitter does not have current regulation circuitry.

#Features

-Bipolar current output up to 30 A
-Duty cycle determined by XMT-G
-1 microsecond turnoff into resistive load
-Less than 150 microseconds turnoff into a 100 meter loop at 20 amperes
-Lightweight, battery powered
