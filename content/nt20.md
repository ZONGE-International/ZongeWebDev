# Description

The turn-off of the transmitter, as well as the sample rate of the receiver, is a critical component in the ablity of a TEM system to image the shallow electrical section - the length of the turn-off acting as a filter on the decay and therefore removing the response of thin layer.

Tturn-off of the NT-20 into a 20m x 20m loop is approximately 1 microsecond. When coupled with the high speed sampling of the GDP-3224, the NT-20 is a unique tool for the investigation of shallow groundwater applications with resolution in the upper 2-3 meters.
