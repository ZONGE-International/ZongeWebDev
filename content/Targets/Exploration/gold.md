# Mapping of Resistivity for Silicification

Since Zongeâ€™s main office is in Nevada, gold exploration is a very important part of our business. We do our best to maintain a product line of instruments and field services that are well suited to this application.

Our clients' survey goals often include locating structures and delineating alteration. Of course, if we could directly detect gold, we would do that, but although geophysics is cheaper than drilling, it is not a substitute. Gravity and magnetics are often completed during the initial stages of grassroots exploration efforts.

If silicification (resistive) and clay alteration (low resistivity) are expected to be better vectors than sulfides, an IP/Resistivity survey often follows. Given that IP/Resistivity is labor-intensive and more expensive on a per line-km basis, CSAMT can also be a great choice to follow up. Zonge now has the ability to do 3D CSAMT inversions, including the near-field data, which greatly increases the depth extent of the models. But for a more tried-and-true method of deep exploration, MT surveys are still a great choice.

# Induced Polarization for Sulfides

If there are sulfides expected to be associated with the ore deposit, an IP/Resistivity survey often follows. Given the labor-intensive nature of IP/Resistivity and its cost per line-km, CSAMT can be an excellent follow-up technique. This approach is particularly useful for identifying sulfide-related mineralization patterns.

# Mapping of Resistivity for Structure

Mapping structures using resistivity methods helps delineate subsurface geological features that can influence mineral deposition. These surveys provide critical information for targeting potential ore zones and guiding further exploration efforts.

# Mapping of Structure Using Magnetics

Gravity and magnetics are often used during the early stages of exploration. Magnetic surveys are particularly effective in mapping structural features associated with mineralization. By analyzing magnetic anomalies, geologists can infer the presence of fault zones, intrusions, and other key geological structures that control ore deposition.

# Mineral Systems Understanding Using MT

For a well-established deep exploration method, MT (Magnetotellurics) surveys remain a reliable choice. They provide valuable insights into the large-scale structural framework of mineral systems, helping to identify deep-seated conductive and resistive zones that may be linked to mineralization processes.
