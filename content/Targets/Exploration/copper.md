# Exploration for Copper

## Introduction

Copper exploration has been a significant focus for Zonge, starting in porphyry country (Arizona). We expect to be active in the copper realm for years to come, as the world continues to rely upon this industrial metal. Most, if not all, new porphyry discoveries are likely to be completely blind, with the odds of finding one with much alteration exposed being slim.

Porphyries are fascinating targets for exploration due to the influence of alteration on certain physical properties such as resistivity and magnetic intensity. The erosional level must also be considered when interpreting these responses. Their footprint is large enough to make them detectable but small enough that there are still some out there to be found. The geophysical responses can also vary between Copper-Gold and Moly-Copper-Gold types. The presence of a supergene enrichment zone in the form of chalcocite can also have a significant influence on resistivity. 

IP/resistivity (DCIP) surveys are commonly applied to porphyries, and the large pyrite halos often make a good target. Magnetics are often the first method used for porphyry exploration. Broad magnetic lows, donut-shaped lows, and embayments associated with magnetic destructive alteration are often followed up with IP/MT surveys. Zonge employs the ZEN (Zonge Electromagnetic Network) Distributed Array System for these surveys. IP/resistivity is conducted during the day, while MT readings take place overnight. The extra depth and better resolution of resistivity from MT, compared to DC resistivity, can be highly useful in interpretation.

Zonge also collaborates with Blue Green Geophysics to invert DCIP/MT data as CSEM. The IP component of this inversion features better removal of EM coupling by modeling the "full physics response." We believe this provides a modern, cutting-edge tool for porphyry exploration. 

The section on “CR” provides more information regarding SIP and Zonge’s frequency domain roots. Although we have no problem running time-domain surveys, we are happy to work with our clients’ preferences.
