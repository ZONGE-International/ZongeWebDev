#Target
Water is an important, often controlling, part of the earths electrical resistivity structure.  The permeability of the subsurface is also highly dependent upon rock type.

#Physical Properties
The electrical resistivity of water with no TDS is extremely high.  But naturally occuring waters include some TDS, and therefore form lower resistivity zones.  This lower resistivity is compounded by the fact that water alters rocks, and the resulting alteration is conductive.
