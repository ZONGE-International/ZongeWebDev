# Target

Most of the lithium exploration Zonge has done has been for brine. Generally, this has taken place on the playas of Nevada and Utah. These would be called salars in South America. The most common approach is to run MT and to help target the lowest resistivity portion of the playa. This is generally assumed to correspond to areas of higher TDS. Drilling is necessary to determine if there are anomalously high lithium values present. Gravity is often also undertaken to help understand the basin geometry.

# Physical Properties

Lithium occurs in different geological settings, primarily in the form of brine, claystone, and pegmatite.

- **Brine Deposits**: Typically found in salars or playas, where lithium-rich fluids accumulate. These are identified using MT surveys to locate zones of low resistivity corresponding to higher TDS concentrations.
- **Claystone Deposits**: If the claystone is hosted in a more resistive environment, it could serve as a good CSAMT target, as claystone is generally characterized by low resistivity.
- **Pegmatite Deposits**: Pegmatite lithium deposits have high resistivity and are typically found within low-resistivity hosts. If the resistivity contrast is not clear, microgravity or magnetics may be helpful in delineating pegmatite bodies.

# Methods

- **Magnetotellurics (MT)**: Used to locate the lowest resistivity areas in playas, which can indicate lithium-rich brines.
- **Gravity Surveys**: Help to understand basin geometry and locate structural lows where lithium brines might accumulate.
- **CSAMT (Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magnetotellurics)**: Useful for identifying claystone deposits when hosted in a resistive environment.
- **Microgravity & Magnetics**: Can aid in detecting pegmatite deposits when traditional resistivity methods do not provide a strong contrast.

These methods collectively help in the exploration of lithium across different geological settings, improving the targeting of drilling locations.
