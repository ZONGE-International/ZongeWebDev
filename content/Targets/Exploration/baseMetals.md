# Base Metals Exploration

Although we gave copper its own section under targets, we acknowledge that it is usually considered a base metal.

The base metals that have not yet been extensively detailed are **lead and zinc**. “Massive sulfides” are generally a good source. The lead- and zinc-rich portions of a polymetallic deposit are typically more distal to the source than gold, silver, and copper. This holds true whether it is a **VMS (Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide), SEDEX (Sedimentary Exhalative), CRD (Carbonate Replacement Deposit), Porphyry,** or another polymetallic deposit. The exception might be **Mississippi Valley Type (MVT) deposits,** which are
