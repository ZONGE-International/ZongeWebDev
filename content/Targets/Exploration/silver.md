# Silver Exploration

Although Nevada is the **Silver State**, it is not the only place where we explore for **epithermal deposits**. The efficacy of **magnetics, gravity, CSAMT, and IP** for silver exploration follows the same geophysical principles as gold exploration.

## Polymetallic and CRD Deposits

We also work on many **CRD (Carbonate Replacement Deposits) and polymetallic vein deposits**. These deposits are often conductive, making them excellent targets for geophysical methods such as:

- **CSAMT (Controlled Source Audio-frequency Magnetotellurics)** and **MT (Magnetotellurics)** – Effective for identifying conductive ore bodies.
- **TEM (Transient Electromagnetics) and BHEM (Borehole Electromagnetics)** – Used when sulfide mineralization is massive.
- **IP/Resistivity** – Applied to detect disseminated sulfides near massive sulfides. Combining **IP with MT or CSAMT** can provide an integrated approach for deeper imaging.
- **Gravity Surveys** – Can sometimes directly detect large CRD deposits.
- **Magnetics** – Helps understand structural controls and alteration patterns.

## VMS and SEDEX Deposits

**Volcanogenic Massive Sulfide (VMS) and Sedimentary Exhalative (SEDEX) deposits** vary in conductivity depending on their mineral content. Geophysical methods commonly used for these include:

- **EM (Electromagnetic) Surveys** – Often the first choice due to the conductive nature of these deposits.
- **CSAMT/MT** – Useful for mapping deeper structures associated with mineralization.
- **IP/Resistivity** – Helps identify disseminated sulfide zones.
- **Gravity and Magnetics** – Aid in understanding the deposit’s geological framework.

By integrating these geophysical methods, silver exploration can be optimized for various deposit types, improving the efficiency of resource identification and extraction.
