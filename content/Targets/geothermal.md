# Geothermal and Geophysics

Our geophysical surveys help reveal what’s happening beneath the surface—without drilling a single hole. Zonge provides imaging techniques to identify hot fluids, fractures, and geologic structures that are key to finding and developing geothermal resources. By combining them, we give you a clear, reliable picture of the subsurface, helping reduce risk and guide smarter decisions from the start.
