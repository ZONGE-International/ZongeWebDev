# Geothermal and Geophysics

Our geophysical surveys help reveal what’s happening beneath the surface—without drilling a single hole. Zonge provides imaging techniques to identify hot fluids, fractures, and geologic structures that are key to finding and developing geothermal resources. By combining them, we give you a clear, reliable picture of the subsurface, helping reduce risk and guide smarter decisions from the start.

# Groundwater and Geophysics

Zonge offers advanced geophysical services for groundwater exploration using electrical, electromagnetic (EM), and gravity methods. These non-invasive techniques provide quick, accurate assessments of subsurface conditions, helping to locate and map water-bearing formations. Our methods are cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and ideal for guiding efficient drilling strategies. With minimal environmental impact and rapid data acquisition, Zonge’s geophysical tools deliver reliable insights for groundwater applications.
