# Time-Domain Induced Polarization

## What is Induced Polarization?

{{< figure src="/img/methods/tdipoverview.png" title="What is TDIP" link="https://youtu.be/DZEbVHr5728" width=500 >}}

The Time-Domain Induced Polarization Method (TDIP) is time-domain implementation of the Induced Polarization method, which is in turn an extension of the DC resistivity method. The DC method is effectively a three-dimensional ohm-meter, with current input into the earth in one location and voltage generated everywhere else. The measurement of that voltage and the source current can then be used to calculate an Apparent Resistivity:

where V is the voltage measured at a receiver dipole, the current

This version of the resistivity assumes that things are constant in all directions, termed a 1/2 space.

## Theory

The electrical resistivity can be measured using many geometries of the transmitter and receiver locations, the most general of which is illustrated below. Often surveys are done in specific geometries, each of which has its inherent advantages and disadvantages, but the apparent resistivity can be calculated for any geometry for which the geometric factor K is defined.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

The primary strength of all IP methods is the ability of these tools to map the distribution of dessieminated sulfides. It is this strength that makes the IP method one of the primary exploration tools for sulfide dominated ore deposits. The limitation of the method is with its depth of investigation - which is controlled by the transmitter receiver separation. Deeper sounings require large offsets, at least twice the required depth of investigation. This results in lower signal levels and inherently noisier measurments.

### Depth of investigation:

The depth of investigation in all DC resistivity style measurements is limited by the transmitter(Tx)/receiver(Rx) separation. As the distance between the transmitter and receiver increases, the effective depth of investigation increases. But as the distance between the Tx and Rx increases, the signal levels drop and at some point the signal/noise ratio drops to the point that greater offsets do not add usable information. These tradeoffs between the Tx/Rx offset combine to limit the effective depth of application of the CR method to 2-3 times the dipole lengths.

### Lateral Resolution:

The resolution of the all DC methods in the shallow section is roughly 1/2 the length of the dipoles. As the depth increases, the resolution decreases but the scale of this decrease is difficult to estimate without modeling of the expected target and background geological structure. This allows the examination of the interaction between the acquisition geometry and the geological context of the target.

### Straightforward Logistics:

The logistics of CR are straightforward, if labor intensive. Transmitter dipoles need to be constructed and arrays of receiver dipoles need to be deployed to measure the voltage generated by that injected current. Once these receciver and transmitter dipoles are deployed current needs to be injected over a range of frequencies. The transmitted frequencies must generally be below 1 Hz to minimize the impact of the EM response, a response which increases:
{{< figure src="/img/methods/emcoupling.png" title="Electromagnetic Response" width=275 >}}
where a is the dipole length, f is the frequency, and rho is the resistivity. The result of this is that, as the frequency goes up and/or the resistivity decreases, the electromagnetic response increases to a point that it dominates the total response and makes separation of the EM response from the IP response problematic.

While the logistics of CR are straightforward, they are not trivial. The selection of dipole lengths for the transmitters and receivers has a direct impact on the depth of investigation and the lateral resolution as discussed above.

### Integration with other methods:

As the frequency domain implementation of the IP methods, many of the modeling tools developed for magnetotellurics(MT) and controlled source EM(CSEM) can be utilized for the modeling of CR. For an example, see the IP is CSEM link below, which looks at the inversion of CR data using Mare2dem, a tool originally developed for the inversion of marine CSEM data.

### Susceptibility to Cultural Noise

CR, as all IP methods, are particularly effected by electrical noise in the area of the survey and any
