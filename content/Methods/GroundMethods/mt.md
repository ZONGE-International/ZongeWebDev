# Magnetotellurics

The magnetotelluric (MT) method utilizes naturally generated electromagnetic fields to examine the earth’s electrical resistivity to depths of up to 10’s of kilometers. This is the deepest sounding electromagnetic exploration method and utilizes the most sophisticated receivers, trading the signals generated by transmitters low noise sensors and electronics and more sophisticated data processing tools.

## Theory

The MT method utilizes measurements of the natural time varying electric and magnetic fields at the earth’s surface. The ratio of these fields is a function of the subsurface resistivity structure:

{{< figure src="/img/methods/mtapparentresistivity.png" title="" width=200 >}}
where ρ_a is the apparent resistivity in ohm-m, f is the frequency in Hertz, E is the electric field, and H is the magnetic field. In essence, throught measurement of the electric and magnetic fields over a range of frequencies, the MT method uses a ratio of these fields to map the subsurface electrical resistivity.
Source
The time-varying natural field comes from two primary sources. The first source is generated by globally occurring lightning storms. The signals from these storms are enhanced by a wave guide, creating p\ositive reinforcement of the electromagnetic signal at specific frequencies, which increases in the signal level at discrete frequencies. These increases in the electromagnetic spectrum are the Schuman Resonances and results in increased signal at 7.8, 14.3, 27.3, and 33.3 Hz .

The second source of the earth’s time-varying is the solar wind, created by the solar wind interacting with the earth's magnetic field and the conductive portions of the earth’s atmosphere. This is the primary source signals at frequencies below 1 Hz.

## CSAMT

One method commonly utilized to increase the signal levels in MT is to install a transmitter and generate a signal. In the areas close to the transmitter, termed the near-field, the geometry of the field in the earth is effectively DC. In this area the field is controlled by the geometry of the transmitter and receivers (noted as A on the figure below). [CSAMT Method]({{< ref "csamt" >}} 'CSAMT Method Page')

The far-field, labeled as C in this figure, is a regime in which the depth of investigation is a function of frequency and resistivity. The ratio of the electric and magnetic fields in this area is independent of geometry and is a function of the subsurface resistivity and frequency, identical to that of the natural source version of MT which allows MT and CSAMT methods to utilize the same modeling tools.
Historically CSAMT methods have been limited to only the far-field. Recent advances in the modeling tools enables the application of these methods to the near-field, through the transition zone, and on to the formal far-field. Integration of the near-field, transition zone, and far-field responses into a single resistivity model significantly increases the resolution of electromagnetic measurements. The value of treating this data as CSEM is further discussed at [CSAMT]({{< ref "csamt" >}} 'CSAMT Method').

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Depth of investigation:

The primary strength of the MT method is its unrivaled depth of investigation, unique among the electromagnetic methods. The MT depth of investigation is determined by the attenuation of the EM field as it propagates into the subsurface. The traditional parameterization is the skin depth, the depth at which the exponentially decaying field decreases to 1/e, or approximately 37% of its surface amplitude.  
The skin depth calculation can be reduced to:  
{{< figure src="/img/methods/skindepthequation.png" title="Skin Depth - A Function of Frequency and Resistivity" width=400 >}}
Control of the depth of investigation of the MT method solely by the frequency and resistivity is what gives MT its power. Assuming average bulk resistivities of 100 ohm-m and frequencies of 0.002 Hz easily attained MT can image resistivity variations at depths of 50 km or more without requiring a large station footprint. This makes it very effective in exploring at depth in areas with limited access.

### Lateral Resolution:

As an indirect result of the MT depth of investigation being controlled by frequency is that depth of investigation is not controlled by the acquisition geometry. The survey types which are confined to the near-field, such as DC resistivity, require that the transmitter and receiver separation increase to investigate deeper. In most cases this requires that the transmitter dipole, and often the receiver dipole, increase in length to maintain signal/noise. For TEM measurements, which utilize the decay of the EM field as it propagates into the subsurface, the transmitter loop moment must also increase to maintain signal to noise. In both cases, as the acquisition footprint grows and more of the earth is integrated into the measurement, the lateral resolution decreases.
MT is immune to this effect. The depth of investigation is completely independent of the geometry of each station. The resolution of the method is instead governed by the subsurface resistivity contrasts, the range of acquisition frequencies, and the aperture of the suite of receivers. This allows high resolution of the shallow section without compromising the ability of the method to image variations in the deeper section.

### Straightforward Logistics:

One of the primary strengths of the MT method is the straightforward field logistics. As it uses a natural source, transmitters are not required, and the depth of investigation is independent of geometry. This allows receivers to be placed where access permits, not where acquisition geometry requires. In addition, each MT receiver system is electrically independent from other measurements made simultaneously. Finally, an entire MT system weights less than 40 kg, allowing an entire system to be mobilized to a remote site on foot with a two-person crew.

The logistics of MT acquisition are further simplified by the general ease of permitting. The impact of an MT station is roughly equivalent to an overnight campsite. With proper backfilling of all holes dug in the installation of the site, all trace of the occupation can be gone within a matter of weeks. In more extreme situations reasonable results have been acquired without burial of the magnetic field sensors, instead surrounding them in sandbags to minimize wind noise. This further reduces the impact of the acquisition.

The straightforward logistics are offset by the care required in deploying the sensors and the complication of the processing efforts. The signals measured using MT are small, requiring care in every stage of the deployment and processing. Poor installation of electrodes, insufficiently emplaced magnetic field sensors, contaminated connections - any of these can render MT data unusable.

### Integration with other methods:

Several inversion tools now exist to provide joint inversion of MT and CSEM (including CR) data, as well as inclusion of gravity data. These joint inversions allow the strengths of each acquisition type to influence the modelled result.

### Susceptibility to Cultural Noise

The signals generated by modern civilization complicate the collection of MT data, limiting its application to areas distant from urban areas. As the MT method utilizes the natural field, there is no control on the source and therefore you can’t increase the signal. Therefore, the primary tool for increasing the Signal/Noise ratio of the measurements is to attempt to reduce the noise.  
The primary tool in reducing the impact of this is to use the Remote Reference method. Remote reference uses observation of the natural field in an area with noise uncorrelated with the area of interest to identify signal. The remote reference method also reduces the impact of internal sensor noise and provides significantly

# Logistics

The MT method is a frequency domain EM method. S

## Receiver

As discussed above, the receiver for MT measurements is logistically simple, consisting in the simplest case of a time synchronized data recoding unit, an electric field dipole, and a magnetic field sensor. In this “simplest case” of a single electric and magnetic field measurement we have a “scalar” measure of the resistivity. Additional information about the resistivity structure can be obtained through measurement of additional orientations of the electric and magnetic field. The complete mapping of the field, consisting of measurement of two orthogonal electric field and three magnetic field measurements is a complete tensor description of the field and is the standard for standalone measurements. Numerous geometries in between the Scalar and Tensor measurements are also utilized, primarily in the linear arrays utilized in CSEM/IP surveys – Link to CSEM- New Tab. Combining frequency-domain controlled source measurements with the MT measurements in a single inversion process allows the simultaneous collection of deep, high lateral, resolution resistivity and Induced Polarization data.
The primary logistics concerns for MT revolve around the limited signal strength. The signal levels are generally small, requiring sophisticated magnetic field sensors and care in the installation of the electric field measurements. The time required for MT measurements is also significantly more than that required for the controlled-source measurements, with measurements from 1 Hz to 10KHz taking approximately 1 hour while data collection below 1 Hz generally requires acquisition times of 12 hours or more.

## Source

As discussed above, the MT methods uses the weather (space weather at frequencies below 1 Hz, lightning storms at frequencies above 1 Hz) to generate electromagnetic fields. This reliance on remote, naturally occurring, sources drive both the strengths and weaknesses of the MT method.

# Targets

Over the last 30 years the MT method has moved from being primarily a research tool utilized by Academia to being an important part of the exploration toolbox. MT excels as a structure mapping tool and as a tool for the mapping of the fluid phase of the subsurface. The examples below explore both significant types of application.
