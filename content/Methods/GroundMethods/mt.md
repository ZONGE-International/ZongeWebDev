## Method (ohm·m)

### Introduction

The magnetotelluric (MT) method is a passive imaging technique that utilizes naturally occurring electromagnetic fields to examine subsurface structures to depths of up to 10’s of kilometers. This is the deepest sounding electromagnetic exploration method.

The signal source comes from global-scale lightning discharges and solar wind, and the resolution is governed by subsurface resistivity contrasts as a function of frequency. Using grounded dipoles and sensitive magnetic field antennas, the electrical and magnetic fields are measured over a suite of frequencies (0.001-1,000Hz) and produce apparent resistivity measurements (_ohm\*m_) that represent the geologic structures at depth. Each station is occupied for multiple hours, often overnight.

The Audio-Magnetotelluric (AMT) method encompasses the higher frequency band of the MT spectrum (>1Hz) and is better suited for shallower imaging (from a few meters to a few kilometers in depth). AMT is often used in tandem with MT.

## Applications

MT excels in regions with little to no cultural interference and is capable of seeing through conductive overburdens and alluvial basins, and is a great supplementary tool to other geophysical surveys :

- Deep geologic structures (500+m deep), with near-surface detail up to approx. 500m (from a zonge flyer… not sure about this just trying to supply both depth and lateral resolution capabilities)/
- Mineral, groundwater, geothermal exploration
- Mining and water resource management

| **Depth**           | 100’s-1000’s meter. Function of resistivity structure and frequency (low f = deep)             |
| **Station Spacing** | Often 10-200m. The received signal strength is proportional to the station spacing             |
| **Scale**           | Localized grid or profiles of electrodes, regional scales                                      |
| **Cost**            | Mid cost.                                                                                      |
| **Production**      | Stations are typically acquired overnight, where approximately 4-8 sites are deployed per day. |
