# Gravity (mGal)

## Method

### Introduction

A gravity survey consists of taking measurements of Earth’s gravitational field, which varies based on the density of the material below each measurement point on the surface. As the density of the material increases, so does the acceleration due to gravity at that location. Zonge produces the Complete Bouger Anomaly measurement for each station, by subtracting the theoretical gravity response from the observed with additional height corrections, and produces a density of the representative subsurface variations. A gravity survey may be designed as a grid, profiles, or sparsely populated stations across an area of interest using 1-2 people, a gravimeter, and a base station.

## Applications

Gravity surveys are a common tool for identifying density contrasts in the subsurface.

**This can be applied to:**

- identifying structures (hanging vs foot wall zones, shearing zones)

- Detection of voids (karst terrain)

- Alterations zones (may be detected as a gravity low)

- Massive body targets

| **_Parameter_**     | **_Description_**                                                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Depth**           | The depth is inferred based on the wavelength of the anomaly                                                      |
| **Station Spacing** | Optimal station spacings should not be greater than the lateral extent of the target, ideally 1-2x smaller than the target dimension. |
| **Scale**           | Local to Regional scale survey type                                                             |
| **Cost**            | Low-cost relative to other geophysical methods.                                                           |
| **Timing**          | Based on station spacing and terrain, multiple stations acquired per day.             |

## Instrumentation

- Lacoste & Romberg G Meters (link)

- Scintrex CG5 (link) when higher precision measurements (typical repeatability of 0.01 mGal) are required. 

- It is required to use geodetic-grade GPS receivers to obtain accurate position information (most importantly elevation)

## Deliverables

- Color contoured plan-view maps of Complete Bouger Anomaly (CBA) made at the selected reduction density
- Contoured plan-view maps of the horizontal gradient and calculated 1st derivative

## Survey Life Cycle

- A local base station is deployed to provide an absolute gravity measurement, taking a measurement at the start and end of the day which accounts for drift.
- A crew of 1-2 people per receiver will take measurements (2 stacks measurements) at each station. This may take anywhere from 5-15 min per station. 
- Data undergoes QA/QC procedures including evaluation of repeat measurements and loop closures to meet specifications. 
- The Complete Bouger Anomaly measurement (CBA) is produced through the data-reduction process, which includes correcting for the Free-air (elevation), Bouger (terrain), latitude (Earth’s curvature), and tidal variations. Zonge routinely delivers the first vertical derivative and horizontal gradient of the dataset.
- Further modeling and interpretation may include completing inversions and trend removal.
