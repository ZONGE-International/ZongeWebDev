# Controlled-Source Audio Magnetotelluric (CSAMT)

## Method (ohm·m)

### Introduction

CSAMT measures the resistivity structure of the Earth’s subsurface.  
Measurements are made using grounded electric dipoles and magnetic antennas that receive signals from a distant transmitter dipole across a range of frequencies.  
These measurements vary by frequency and detect contrasts in resistivity caused by changes in geology, such as lithology or fluid content.  
Data are generally collected in the far-field, where depth of investigation is frequency-dependent, but recent 3D CSAMT inversions now incorporate near-field data to improve resolution and depth coverage.  
The processed data produce resistivity models that can be interpreted geologically.

## Applications

CSAMT surveys are a common tool for identifying resistivity contrasts and imaging geologic structures.  
They are effective in both reconnaissance and detailed targeting stages of exploration, and complement other geophysical techniques.

**This method can be applied to:**

- Depth to bedrock and geologic structure boundaries
- Identification of silicified zones and fluid pathways
- Mapping faults and shear zones with alteration or brecciation
- Water-table imaging and aquitard mapping
- Detection of subsurface contamination

**Common commodities and resources imaged by CSAMT:**

- Geothermal reservoirs
- Base and precious metal deposits
- Groundwater resources
- Hydrocarbon targets

## Survey Design

**Depth:**  
Typically reaches hundreds of meters, depending on frequency and subsurface resistivity.  
Vertical resolution ~5–20% of profile length.

**Spacing:**  
Dipoles usually range from 10–200 m.  
Station spacing influences received signal quality and resolution.

**Scale:**  
Surveys may use localized grids or profile lines with 4–6 dipoles per measurement array.

**Cost:**  
Moderate to high, depending on site logistics, grid size, and number of stations.

**Timing:**  
Production is typically 5–15 receiver arrays per operator per day.
