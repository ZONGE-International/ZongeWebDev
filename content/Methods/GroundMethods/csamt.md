# Controlled-Source Audio Magnetotelluric (CSAMT)

## Method (ohm·m)

### Introduction

CSAMT surveys are utilized to measure the calculated resistivity structure of the Earth. A transmitter dipole is deployed at a large distance away from the receiver grid, transmitting a controlled electrical signal over a range of frequencies. The orthogonal components of the electric and magnetic fields are measured at the receiver with grounded dipoles and a magnetic antenna. The resistivity values relate to the geological response of the ground, providing information on resistivity contrasts of more or less resistive rock packages or structures. 

Data are generally collected in the far-field, where depth of investigation is frequency-dependent, but recent 3D CSAMT inversions now incorporate near-field data to improve resolution and depth coverage.  

Zonge is producing 3D CSAMT inversions which includes the near-field data and expands the depth of the model.

## Applications

CSAMT surveys are a common tool for identifying resistivity contrasts and imaging geologic structures.  
They are effective in both reconnaissance and detailed targeting stages of exploration, and complement other geophysical techniques.

**This method can be applied to:**

- Depth to bedrock and geological structures or lithologies

- Silicified structures in host rocks or fluid pathways

- Fault and shear zones with silicification, altered or brecciated material

- Water-table trends, aquitard imaging

- Contaminant locations for mineral, hydrology and petroleum investigations

        The depth is dependent on transmitted frequency and resistivity of the subsurface, often in the 100’s of meters range.<br>
        Vertical resolution is often estimated to be 5–20% of the profile length.
