# ANT/7

## Magnetic Antenna

### DESCRIPTION

The ANT/7 is a low-noise magnetic field sensor designed for magnetotelluric investigations and other applications where measurements of the field at frequencies below 1 Hz are required. Using Triple-Nested magnetic feedback amplifier technology and including carefully designed mu-metal cores, this antenna is designed to be a highly flexible instrument, built to withstand the difficult conditions encountered in the field environment.
