### DESCRIPTION

The ANT/4 is a low-noise magnetic field sensor designed for magnetotelluric investigations and other applications where measurements of the field at frequencies below 1 Hz are required. Using Triple-Nested magnetic feedback amplifier technology and including carefully designed mu-metal cores, this antenna is designed to be a highly flexible instrument, built to withstand the difficult conditions encountered in the field environment.

### OPTIONS

Highpass can be set down to 0.01 Hz at an extra cost of $400.

The following parameters can be adjusted to customer requirements at no extra cost:

- Highpass can be set as low as 0.05 Hz.
- Lowpass can be set as low as 10 Hz and up to 1200 Hz
- Output sensitivity can be set between 10 mV to 500 mV/g. 500 mV/g would be used for seafloor applications.
