### Controls Zonge Transmitters

The XMT-G Transmitter Controller produces timing signals for controlling all the Zonge Engineering GGT, ZT and NT transmitters. Provision is made for synchronizing multiple controllers and GDP receivers. Frequency control can be accomplished either manually or by a time sequence program which is loaded through the RS-232c port. Time sequence status and frequency are displayed on an LCD on the front panel. Can operate either by oven-controlled clock or GPS.

### Features

- Time or frequency domain control
- Frequency range: 1024 second period to 8192 Hz
- Compatible with all Zonge-series transmitters
- Automatic transmitter control via time table
- GPS discipline of clock
- LCD frequency display
