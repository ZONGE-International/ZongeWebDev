# ZT-30B Geophysical Transmitter

{{< figure src="/img/power/zt30b.png" title="ZT-30B" width=500 style="display: block; margin: auto;" >}}

The ZT-30B is a transmitter capable of producing time-domain or frequency-domain waveforms into either resistive or inductive loads. As a TEM transmitter, the ZT-30B can deliver up to 30A into a 100m loop with a turnoff time of less than 200 µs. Because the ZT-30B also performs well while transmitting into resistive loads, some customers can use it as a low-power resistivity transmitter.

## Features

- Bipolar current output up to 30 A
- 50 or 100 % duty cycle
- 1 µs turnoff into resistive load
- Reverse polarity input protection
- Less than 150 µs turnoff into a 100 meter loop at 20 amperes
- Lightweight, externally powered
