## Zonge Electromagnetic Network

The new Zonge Electromagnetic Network (ZEN™) receiver is a high-resolution, multi-channel receiver for acquisition of controlled- and natural-source geo-electric and EM data.

---

### Key Benefits

- Uses **32-bit analog-digital converters** designed specifically for geophysical applications
- Signals not detected with conventional 16- or 24-bit receivers are easily detected with ZEN’s 32-bit resolution
- Reliable even in areas with cultural noise

---

### Distributed Acquisition, Wireless Arrays

- True distributed acquisition system
- Survey setup is easier — analog signals can be measured based on terrain and access
- Flexibility for real-world field conditions

---

### Applications

- Resistivity, Time/Frequency Domain IP, CR
- CSAMT, Harmonic Analysis CSAMT (HACSAMT), AMT, MT
- DC to 1024 Hz
- Controlled Source/IP: 1/64 to 1024 Hz
- Use as analog or borehole data logger

---

### Lightweight & Field Ready

- Designed for **high performance** and **lower deployment cost** in MT data collection
- Collects **highest resolution data currently possible**
- Weighs **less than 6 pounds (2.6 kg)**
- Portable for small crews on large-scale surveys

---

### Integrated System

- Rugged, portable, environmentally sealed
- Modular design for easy upgrades
- Fully compatible with Zonge transmitters and ancillary gear
- Native **GPS synchronization** with transmitter
- **ZigBee® Radio Control**
- Broadband time-series recording
- **60 MHz ARM CPU**
- 1 to 6 channels, user expandable
- One 32-bit ADC per channel
- Auto gain setting and internal calibration
- **Storage: 8 GB per channel** — holds several days of data
- USB data transfer
