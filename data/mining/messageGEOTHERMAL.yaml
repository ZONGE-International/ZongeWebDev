Hydrothermal Systems:
  Magnetic: |
    Fracture mapping > Moderate contrast with surrounding rock
    Magnetite alteration > Sometimes creates weak anomalies
  Gravity: |
    Low-density alteration zones > Gravity lows
    Deep reservoir mapping > Poor sensitivity for fluid zones
  CSAMT/AMT: |
    Clay-rich cap rock > Very low resistivity
    Fault conduits > High resistivity contrast zones
  MT: |
    Deep structure imaging > Limited depth resolution in complex terrains
    Resistive zones > May be masked by conductive overburden
  IP: |
    Altered zones > Weak to moderate chargeability
    Fracture zones > Can show minor effects if sulfides are present
  EM: |
    Clay cap detection > High conductivity
    Fracture networks > Well imaged when water-filled

Enhanced Geothermal:
  Magnetic: |
    Heat fractures > Slightly enhanced contrast in some terrains
  Gravity: |
    High-density intrusions > Gravity highs over heat sources
  CSAMT/AMT: |
    Heat transfer zones > Resistivity contrast around reservoirs
  MT: |
    Deep heat source > Detectable in resistivity gradients
  IP: |
    Fractured zones > Limited usefulness unless sulfides present

Fault-related Geothermal:
  Magnetic: |
    Fault offsets > Detected as magnetic breaks
