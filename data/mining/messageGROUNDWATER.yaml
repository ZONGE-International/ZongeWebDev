Lithologic and water table:
  Magnetic: |
    Magnetite destructive > Loss of magnetic signal
    Major structures > Magnetic lineaments useful for mapping

  Gravity: |
    Deep intrusives > Gravity highs
    Density contrasts > Detectable gravity anomalies in subsurface

  CSAMT/AMT: |
    Massive silica/silicification > High resistivity
    Mineralized quartz veins within broad zones of silicification > Resistivity highs

  MT: |
    Deep intrusives > Moderate resistivity contrast
    Alteration zoning > Electrical variations with zoning
    High sulphide content > Reduces resistivity

  IP: |
    Alteration (low resistivity) > Chargeable if sulphides present
    Disseminated sulphides (veins) > Moderate chargeability

  EM: |
    Clay alteration > Reduced resistivity, strong EM response

Contaminants:
  Magnetic: |
    Magnetite destructive > May indicate altered zones
    Major structures > Can control contaminant pathways

  Gravity: |
    Deep intrusives (source) > Gravity high from dense rocks

  CSAMT/AMT: |
    Clay-pyrite alteration > Low resistivity
    Sulphide veining > Moderate resistivity reduction

  MT: |
    Deep intrusives > Resistive background anomalies

  IP: |
    High sulphide content > High chargeability
    Clay alterations (reduced resistivity) > Moderate chargeability
    Late-stage and postmineral > Variable responses

  EM: |
    Clay alteration > Reduced resistivity, conductive response
